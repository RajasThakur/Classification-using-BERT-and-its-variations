# Classification-using-BERT-and-its-variations
We have used the 20 Newsgroups dataset available in sklearn to perform classification task.
We have used BERT and tried to tweaked it to improve the results. We also have used variation of BERT (Roberta and MobileBERT) for improving our scores. 
We have used RNNs in all scenarios after getting word embeddings.
